About
Richard hails from Tulsa. He has earned degrees from the University of Oklahoma and Stanford. (Go Sooners
and Cardinals!) Before starting Pied Piper, he worked for Hooli as a part time software developer. While his
work focuses on applied information theory, mostly optimizing lossless compression schema of both the
length-limited and adaptive variants, his non-work interests range widely, everything from quantum
computing to chaos theory. He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a “length-limited”
conversation!
